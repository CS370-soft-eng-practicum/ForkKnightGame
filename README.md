An android version of the project has been created. It should work on most current android devices (tablets, phones, etc).

To run the Android Version of the project you will need to have the following:

An Android Device (Version 2.2 or Higher)
Android APK
Windows OS (optional, but this guide is for windows)
USB connection to OS


A tutorial is as follows:

1. The download links are as follows: http://code.google.com/android/intro/installing.html
2. http://dl.google.com/android/android_usb_windows.zip
3. You need to modify your Android’s settings to allow the installation of applications from other sources. Under “Settings,” select “Application Settings” and then enable “Unknown Sources.” Also under “Settings,” select “SD Card” and “Phone Storage,” and finally enable “Disable Use for USB Storage”
4. This last step is easy. Open Command Prompt and type the following: adb install <1>/<2>.apk
5. However, when you type the command, replace <1> with the path to your APK file and replace <2> with the name of the APK file. (In this case "AndroidTest.apk")
6. You’re done! Your application is now ready for your use and enjoyment.
